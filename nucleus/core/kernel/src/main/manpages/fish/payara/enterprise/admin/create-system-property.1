create-system-property(1)  asadmin Utility Subcommands  create-system-property(1)

NAME
       create-system-property - adds or updates a single system property
       of the domain, configuration, cluster, or server instance

SYNOPSIS
           create-system-property [--help]
           [--target target]
           [name=value]

DESCRIPTION
       The create-system-property subcommand adds or updates a single system
       property that can be referenced elsewhere on the server.

       Payara Server provides hooks where tokens (system properties) can be
       specified. Because Payara Server does not have multiple server
       elements, you can specify a particular token at any level. When a
       domain supports multiple servers, the override potential can be
       exploited. When a domain is started or restarted, all <system-property>
       elements are resolved and available to the Java Virtual Machine by
       using the System.setProperty() call on each of them (with its name and
       value derived from the corresponding attributes of the element). This
       is analogous to sending the elements as -D parameters on the Java
       command line.

       This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.
